# LIDAR-Based-Obstacle-Avoidance-for-TurtleBot-in-ROS-Gazebo
This project demonstrates a basic obstacle-avoiding robot using LIDAR and TurtleBot in a simulated ROS environment. It leverages a 360Â° LIDAR sensor to detect nearby obstacles and enables the robot to navigate autonomously by avoiding collisions in real time. It was built as a learning exercise to explore fundamental ROS concepts like topics, sensor data processing, and robot simulation in Gazebo. 

#Technologies Used

ROS (Robot Operating System),
TurtleBot3 (Burger model),
LIDAR (LaserScan sensor data),
Gazebo (for robot simulation).
